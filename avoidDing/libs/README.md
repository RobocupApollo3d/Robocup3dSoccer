# Libs
---
Place shared objects that you want the agent to load at runtime in this directory which is added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in start scripts.  Adding shared objects to this directory ensures that they will be found when copying to and running the binary on another computer such as for a competition.   Run [scripts/copy_libs.sh](../scripts/copy_libs.sh) to automatically copy all of the binary's linked shared objects to this directory.  Note that some libraries may not be compatible with later/future OS releases (e.g. the default version of libc on Ubuntu 14.04 is not compatible with Ubuntu 16.04).
